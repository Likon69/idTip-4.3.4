I modify this addon to have in addition to the items and spell ids I wanted to know the ids of the npc.

The code was found here https://www.wowinterface.com/forums/showthread.php?t=49521 It was modified for cataclysm.

In addition to displaying the ids you can press Alt and aim at a npc it will write the id in the game chat.

If you do the same for ctrl it will write the npc name to you.
